# Exploratory_Data_Analysis
This is the work I have done for visualizing data and gather new insights for different datasets by comparing various variables to get a proper understanding of the dataset. The importance of exploratory data analysis in understanding and gaining insights from data before diving into more complex analysis. EDA allows us to uncover patterns and relationships in data that we may not have initially expected, leading to a better understanding of the underlying data and ultimately better decision making.

EDA Includes - 
Loading the Dataset chosen in python
Importing the required libraries - numpy,pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
Data Cleaning - Handling duplicates, Outliers, NA values
Undersatnding the Big Picture - Univariate Analysis and Bivariate Analysis with categorical and numerical variables.

This Repository includes EDA on these datasets
